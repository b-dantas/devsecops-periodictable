# Periodic Table of DevSecOps Tools

## Click [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/b-dantas/devsecops-periodictable/blob/master/index.htm) to see the DevSecOps periodic table running :-)
> **DISCLAIMER**: The current state of this periodic table is stub, which means just a few "elements" was put in place. So, sometimes is required to start...

## What's is this?
Probably you have hear about [Digital.ai Periodic Table of DevOps Tools](https://digital.ai/learn/devops-periodic-table/) (in the past XebiaLabs). So, this my effort is similar, but it aims to arrange a set of tools for security into DevOps, which someones call DevSecOps.

Initially, I glued a [template of a chemical periodic table](http://cssdeck.com/labs/periodic-table/) to built this one. As soon as I got more time, I'll back to refectory it or someone who interested to change it, feel free.

## How can I contribute?
It's quite easy. The more simple way is opening an issue requesting to add a security tool. Moreover, if you are familiar editing HTML code, feel free to edit it and open a pull request to merge it with the master branch.
